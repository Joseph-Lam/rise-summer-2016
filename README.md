##About
Rise Women's Legal Centre is a community resource developed to help women, and people who identify as women, get the legal assitence they need.

Rise went through a UX research and design process with a small group of UX students from the summer 2016 cohort at RED Academy to assess the nessesary changes for a whole website redesign. Which was then handed over to be built out.

The final product is a fully functioning, custom WordPress theme developed specifically for Rise Women's Legal Centre
