#Rise Women's Legal Centre Website Re-design & build

Developed by [Joseph Lam](https://github.com/Joseph-Lam "Joseph's Github Profile!") & [Terra Pope](https://github.com/teeppope "Terra's Github Profile!")

##About
Rise Women's Legal Centre is a community resource developed to help women, and people who identify as women, get the legal assitence they need.

Rise went through a UX research and design process with a small group of UX students from the summer 2016 cohort at RED Academy to assess the nessesary changes for a whole website redesign. Which was then handed over to be built out by two developers from the summer 2016 Web Dev cohort.

The final product is a fully functioning, custom WordPress theme developed specifically for Rise Women's Legal Centre.

##Technology Used for the Project
###WordPress
This site was built to become a custom theme on WordPress for Rise Legal. One of the main features of the website was the Legal Contact Form, and it would not have been possible without using the Gravity Forms Plugin on WordPress. It helped provide an easy layout for creating a multi-paged form. Custom Field Suites was another plugin that allowed pages to be made and hold content easily editable by the client without needing an extensive knowledge of coding. 

###PHP/HTML5
The foundation of the site was initially built using a RED academy starter theme but the structure and hierarchy of the pages are made strictly using php inside of HTML to dynamically load content from the WordPress Database.

###CSS3/SASS
We used the CSS preprocessor SASS to easily style our website. We used well thought out variables, mixins and classes to keep design elements consistent on the page.

###Javascript/jQuery
jQuery was used on this site to add functionality and a level of interaction consistent with the designers wishes.


##Meaningful Takeaways
As a class, this was our first community project where we were able to work in a group, and decide upon the code architecture to complete the project. Working in a pair, we were able to complete this project on time, and with little merge conflicts (thanks to working on separate pages most of the time!).
